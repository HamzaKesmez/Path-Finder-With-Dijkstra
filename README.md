Project Name: PathFinderWithDijkstra

Description:
PathFinderWithDijkstra is an engaging 2D maze-solving game developed using C# and Windows Forms. This project leverages the power of the Dijkstra algorithm to compute the shortest path within the maze, offering a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience.

In this game, players navigate through a labyrinth while managing energy levels, avoiding penalties, and collecting bonuses. The maze environment includes various elements such as walls, paths, energy boosts, and traps, adding complexity and excitement to the journey.

Key Features:

Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine optimal routes.
Energy Management: Players must maintain their energy levels to succeed.
Dynamic Gameplay: Incorporates randomness and environmental challenges to enhance replayability.
Visual Representation: The game displays the player's progress and path visually within the maze.
This project is perfect for exploring algorithmic problem-solving, dynamic programming, and game development concepts in C#.
